# 🚀 Installation Guide

Welcome to the setup guide for **Video Downloader**! The application is **Plug & Play** — no Java installation required. Everything is self-contained.

## Step 1: Requirements

* **Google Chrome:** Required only for the browser extension "Hunting" mode.
* **No Java needed!** A trimmed Java 21 Runtime Environment (JRE) is bundled inside every release package.
  * If the JRE is somehow missing, the launcher will **automatically download it** from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net) on first run (internet required for that one-time step only).

## Step 2: Installing the App

1. Navigate to the **[Releases](../../releases)** page of this repository.
2. Download the archive that matches your Operating System:
   * **Windows:** `VideoDownloader-v1.0.6-Win.zip`
   * **macOS:**
     * `VideoDownloader-v1.0.6-Mac-Intel.tar.gz` (Intel x64)
     * `VideoDownloader-v1.0.6-Mac-AppleSilicon.tar.gz` (Apple Silicon ARM)
   * **Linux:**
     * `VideoDownloader-v1.0.6-Linux-x64.tar.gz` (x64)
     * `VideoDownloader-v1.0.6-Linux-ARM.tar.gz` (ARM64)
   * **Android:**
     * `VideoDownloader-v1.0.6.apk` (standalone — hunts and downloads directly on the phone)
     * `VideoDownloader-v1.0.6-remote-desktop.apk` (companion — sends links from phone to the desktop app)

## 📂 Package Structure (What's Inside)

Once extracted, your installation folder contains:

* **Core App:** `VideoDownloader.jar` — the main compiled application.
* **Launcher Script:** `run.bat` (Windows) or `run.sh` (Mac/Linux) — starts the app.
* **Embedded Runtime:** A trimmed JRE 21 tailored for your platform, built automatically by CI using `jlink`.
* **Engine Tools:** `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` binaries for downloading and converting.

## Step 3: Run the Application

### For Windows Users

1. Extract `VideoDownloader-v1.0.6-Win.zip` to any folder.
2. **Double-click `run.bat`** to launch the app.

> The launcher silently checks for the bundled JRE. If it's missing for any reason, it will download and install it automatically before launching.

### For macOS & Linux Users

Unix-based systems require explicit permission to execute launcher scripts.

1. Extract the downloaded `.tar.gz` archive.
2. Open **Terminal** and navigate to the extracted directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/extracted/folder
   ```
3. Grant execution permission:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```
4. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

> Same as Windows — the launcher auto-detects your OS and architecture, checks for the bundled JRE, and downloads it from Adoptium if missing.

### For Android Users

Install the `.apk` file and allow installation from unknown sources when prompted.

## 🔄 Updating the App

When a new version is available, the app will notify you on launch. You can:
- **Download for my system** — automatically downloads the correct package for your OS/architecture into your Downloads folder.
- **Skip this version** — suppresses the notification for that release.
- **Remind me later** — dismissed until next launch.

After downloading, extract the new archive and replace your old installation folder.
